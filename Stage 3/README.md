# Bazaar Inventory System - Stage 3

A scalable inventory tracking system designed to support thousands of kiryana stores with real-time stock synchronization and audit capabilities.

## System Overview

The Stage 3 system builds upon our previous implementation, evolving from a multi-store solution to a distributed architecture capable of handling high concurrency and transaction volumes. The system maintains a central product catalog while supporting store-specific inventory tracking with comprehensive audit logging.

## Architecture Decisions

### Event-Driven Architecture
I've adopted an event-driven architecture using Kafka as the message broker. This allows:
- Asynchronous processing of inventory updates
- Decoupling of services for independent scaling
- Complete audit trail of all inventory movements
- Near real-time stock synchronization across the system

### Microservices Approach
The system is divided into focused services:
- API Gateway - Authentication, routing, rate limiting
- Catalog Service - Product management
- Inventory Service - Stock tracking and movement
- Transaction Service - Sales and purchase processing
- Analytics Service - Reporting and insights
- Notification Service - Alerts and communications

Each service can scale independently based on demand, with the inventory service likely requiring the most resources during peak times.

### Database Strategy
- PostgreSQL for transactional data with read replicas
- Read/write separation pattern to handle high query loads
- Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Event sourcing for inventory movements provides an immutable audit log

### Security Enhancements
- JWT-based authentication replacing API keys
- Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- Rate limiting at the API gateway level
- Token blacklisting via Redis

### Offline Capabilities
The system supports offline operations through:
- Local caching of essential data
- Operation queueing during connectivity loss
- Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored

## Technical Implementation

### API Gateway
The gateway handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing to the appropriate services. Implemented using FastAPI for performance and ease of development.

### Service Communication
- Synchronous: REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- Asynchronous: Kafka for event-based communication

### Data Storage
- PostgreSQL with read replicas for transactional data
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Kafka for event storage and streaming

### Deployment
The system is containerized and orchestrated with Kubernetes:
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on load
- Separate deployments for each service
- Database clusters with replication

## Evolution from Stage 2

The key improvements from Stage 2 include:

1. **Scalability**: From supporting hundreds of stores to thousands
2. **Architecture**: From monolithic to microservices
3. **Communication**: From synchronous to event-driven
4. **Data Access**: From single database to read/write separation with caching
5. **Authentication**: From API keys to JWT with role-based access control
6. **Deployment**: From simple containers to Kubernetes orchestration

```

Each service follows a similar structure:
```

├── api/            # FastAPI routes
├── domain/         # Business logic
├── persistence/    # Database access
├── events/         # Event handlers
└── config/         # Service configuration
```

## Design Considerations

### Performance
- Connection pooling for database efficiency
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Read replicas for query-heavy operations
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for all components
- Database sharding capabilities for future growth
- Eventual consistency model where appropriate

### Reliability
- Graceful degradation during partial outages
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

### Data Integrity
- Event sourcing ensures complete audit trail
- Transactional boundaries to maintain consistency
- Optimistic concurrency control for inventory updates

## Trade-offs and Considerations

1. **Complexity vs. Scalability**: The microservices approach increases operational complexity but provides better scalability.

2. **Consistency vs. Availability**: The system prioritizes availability during network partitions, with eventual consistency for reporting.

3. **Development Speed vs. Performance**: Some components prioritize development speed (FastAPI) while others prioritize performance (Kafka for high-throughput messaging).

4. **Operational Overhead**: The distributed architecture requires more sophisticated monitoring and operations.

## Future Enhancements

The current architecture supports expansion to:
- Real-time analytics and dashboards
- Inventory forecasting using historical data
- Supplier integration for automated replenishment
- Mobile application support via dedicated API gateway
